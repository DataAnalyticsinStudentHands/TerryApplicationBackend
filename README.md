Terry Web Application
==========

The code is based on Ionic.


Getting started:

1. bower install 

Reads bower.json and installs local dependencies into the folder www/lib

Quck hack for ngNotify -> add z-index: 99 into ngNotify css

2. ionic serve

Reads ionic.xml and will serve as local node server, this updates when you make changes to the code

or 3. phonegap serve

Works with the Phone Gap developer app. Updates also when you make changes.



Need to add phonegap/cordova configuration ...
